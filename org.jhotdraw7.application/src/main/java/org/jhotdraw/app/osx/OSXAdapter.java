 * File: OSXAdapter.java
 *
 * Abstract: Hooks existing preferences/about/quit functionality from an
 * existing Java app into handlers for the Mac OS X application menu.
 * Uses a Proxy object to dynamically implement the
 * com.apple.eawt.ApplicationListener interface and register it with the
 * com.apple.eawt.Application object.  This allows the complete project
 * to be both built and run on any platform without any stubs or
 * placeholders. Useful for developers looking to implement Mac OS X
 * features while supporting multiple platforms with minimal impact.
